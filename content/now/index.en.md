Now I'm living in [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencia) and working in a translation of Marcus Aurelius' Meditations to Portuguese. I'm also working in a content portal named [Est√≥icos](www.estoicos.com.br).

I'm also working with [Eduardo Fuzeto](https://fuzeto.com) on [Delta Containers](https://deltacontainers.com.br/). Goal: lead generation and unique visitors. Focus: SEO, SEM, and Python [Gambiarras](https://blogs.transparent.com/portuguese/i-bet-you-dont-know-what-a-gambiarra-is/) that do whatever needs to be done.

I'm listening to [very brazillian guitar](https://open.spotify.com/user/22juqw35jemx5ymfnpb63ekba/playlist/5tVGPqD0VArJl577af0bIY?si=mjGPefZiT7awUUym5ag7_A) and watching [Choque de Cultura](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u1w1UnqI0Y&list=PL4_UyUPkbEyM52ONAIdYBGFlR4VxWn6nB) in a loop. The last piece of art that enchanted me was [Over the Garden Wall](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3718778/).

Trying to improve my Python skills, and once in a while I'm doing silly stuff with Markov Chains. I'm also trying to improve my Abstract Thiking skills, using [Mental Models](https://www.fs.blog/mental-models/)

I'm reading [MONEY: Master the game](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23014006-money-master-the-game)
