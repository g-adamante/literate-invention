After a season in [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencia), I'm back to Brazil and living between Palmas and Curitiba.

I started a company with Eduardo Fuzeto and Guilherme Zanotto, (Traktor)[https://gotraktor.com]. We are an agency focused on technical solutions. We're working with startups that need to achieve traction.

I'm still listening to [brazillian classical guitar](https://open.spotify.com/user/22juqw35jemx5ymfnpb63ekba/playlist/5tVGPqD0VArJl577af0bIY?si=mjGPefZiT7awUUym5ag7_A) nonstop to work.

I'm learning PKM (Personal Knowledge Management), with (Tiago Forte's)[https://www.fortelabs.co/], course [Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/). I'm hoping it will amount to more writing in this blog.
