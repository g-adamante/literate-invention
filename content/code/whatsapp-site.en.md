## How to use:

Just paste the code somewhere you can put custom HTML/CSS.

### Wordpress:

I'll make a plugin in a couple of weeks.

For now, you can paste it in the footer of your website:

Style > Editor 

![Style Editor](/../img/aparencia-editor.png) 

Go to the file **footer.php** and paste it in the beggining of the file.

**Do not change anything else in this file. Do not delete anything if you don't know what you are doing.**

![Editing footer](/../img/editando-footer.png) 

Don't forget to update the file.
