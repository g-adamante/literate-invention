## Who am I?

Hello, my name is Gabriel. It's not necessary for me to tell you that I hate to write an about me section of anything, as pretty much everyone feels akward doing that. But here I am, so let me introduce myself.

I am a [writer](http://recortelirico.com.br/2016/07/autor-curitibano-se-inspira-no-realismo-magico-em-seu-primeiro-livro) 
(I wrote one short story book that you can find [here](https://www.ciadoslivros.com.br/volta-as-aulas/historias-de-fim-do-mundo-724403-p588160)). 
I'm also a Freelance Digital Marketer, and I used to work for a rockstar brazillian Fintech SaaS called [Contabilizei](http://contabilizei.com.br/) that was on FastCompany's most innovative list on 2017.

I recently left that company and moved out of Brazil to work and live in Europe.

I am very interested in:

- High Literature (specially Latin American)
- Philosophy
- Entrepreneurism and Startups
- Technology in general
- Programming
- Blockchain
- Marketing
- Nutrition
- Self improvement in general
- Thinking and reasoning processes

What I'm up to [Now](/en/now)

## My core values

After Reading [principles](https://www.principles.com/), I knew I had to write down my personal principles.

But I didn't. 

Why? The usual. Many things to do, procrastination, little time dedicated to thinking.

Fortunately, I was going through my e-mail list and found an old subscrition that I hadn't been reading to in a long time.

It was [Taylor Pearson's](https://taylorpearson.me/about/). And it was great. In his website, he talks about core values and why you should make your list too ([have a peek](https://taylorpearson.me/core-values-list/)).

Mine is the following, right now:

#### Freedom: to live freely; to choose how I live and behave, or help others do likewise

The feeling of freedom is so important for me and makes thrive so much. Since I was a kid, I'd run away (to my mother's despair) in the beach because it felt so right doing so. I didn't need a reason. I just wanted to be free. I have lenghtly tought about freedom and what characterizes it, juggling between definitions (political, philosophical, etc.), but I never realized it was so deeply connected to who I am.

#### Self-development: to keep growing, advancing, or improving in knowledge, skills, character, or life experience.

I had a very, very hard time choosing the first attribute on the list. Between Freedom and Self-development, the fight is very tough. I asked the question "would I give up on freedom if that meant I'd be a better person?" and I answer "Yes, I would!", but then I tought : "but the main reason I want to be a better person is so I can achieve freedom". Is it,tough? Isn't the reason self-evident? I want to be a better person because that's my sole obligation on life, my own (and every other human being's) reason to live(!); yes, I do feel that way, that growing and improving myself inherent to my existence. And I know I wouldn't be happy to be free without being self-developing, and neither the other way around. I don't know witch one matters the most, but they are my core values.

#### Independence: to be self-supportive, and choose my own way of doing things

This one is very simple: I'm not wired as most people. I thrive doing things on my own way, and I take responsability for that.  

#### Contribution: to contribute, help, assist, or make a positive difference to myself or others

There are few things that make me more genuinely happy than seeing my friends and the people I like thrive. One of them is to help them thrive. I am so grateful for all this amazing people I had the luck to get to know along my life, and I want to help them be at their best and achieve their goals, and I'll work for that happily.  

#### Creativity: to be creative or innovative

I do love creating things. I do love constructing things. I am happy when I'm building something new.


#### These are the values that I reason with deeply, but didn't make into the Top 5 (they are not in order of importance):

**These are my character, and there is no other way of doing differently:**

- Humility: to be humble or modest; to let my achievements speak for themselves
- Adventure: to be adventurous; to actively seek, create, or explore novel or stimulating experiences
- Curiosity: to be curious, open-minded, and interested; to explore and discover
- Authenticity: to be authentic, genuine, and real; to be true to myself
- Gratitude: to be grateful for and appreciative of the positive aspects of myself, others, and life
- Honesty: to be honest, truthful, and sincere with myself and others
- Assertiveness: to respectfully stand up for my rights and request what I want

**These are what make me thrilled:**

- Courage: to be courageous or brave; to persist in the face of fear, threat, or difficulty
- Excitement: to seek, create, and engage in activities that are exciting, stimulating, or thrilling

**This one is my biggest flaw and needs to be looked at:**

- Self-control: to act in accordance with my own ideals

**These are the things that make me want to wake up every day:**

- Industry: to be industrious, hard-working, and dedicated
- Beauty: to appreciate, create, nurture, or cultivate beauty in myself, others, the environment, etc.
- Creativity: to be creative or innovative

**These are how I want to be with other people:**

- Forgiveness: to be forgiving toward myself or others
- Friendliness: to be friendly, companionable, or agreeable toward others
- Fun: to be fun-loving; to seek, create, and engage in fun-filled activities
- Generosity: to be generous, sharing, and giving, to myself or others
- Humor: to see and appreciate the humorous side of life
- Kindness: to be kind, compassionate, considerate, nurturing, or caring toward myself or others
