## Who am I?

Hello, my name is Gabriel. 

I am a writer (I wrote one short story book that you can find [here](https://www.ciadoslivros.com.br/volta-as-aulas/historias-de-fim-do-mundo-724403-p588160)). I‚Äôm a [Digital Marketer](#hire-me), and I used to work for a rockstar Brazillian Fintech SaaS called [Contabilizei](https://www.fastcompany.com/company/contabilizei).

I also feel very awkward talking about myself like that üò≥. 

I recently left Contabilizei and moved out of Brazil to work and live in Europe.

I am interested in:

- High Literature (especially Latin American)
- Philosophy
- Entrepreneurism and Startups
- Technology in general
- Programming
- Blockchain
- Marketing
- Nutrition
- Self-improvement in general
- Thinking and reasoning processes

## My core values

After Reading [Principles](https://www.principles.com/), I knew I had to write down my personal principles.

But I didn‚Äôt.

Why? The usual. 

Many things to do, procrastination, little time dedicated to thinking.

Fortunately, I was going through my e-mail list and found an old subscription that I hadn‚Äôt been reading to in a long time.

It was [Taylor Pearson‚Äôs](https://taylorpearson.me/about/). And it was great. In his website, he talks about core values and why you should make your list too ([have a peek](https://taylorpearson.me/core-values-list/)).

## Mine is the following, right now:

### Freedom: to live freely; to choose how I live and behave, or help others do likewise

Freedom is essential for me to live at my best. 

I have thought deeply about freedom and what characterizes it, juggling between definitions (political, philosophical, etc.), but I never realized it was so deeply connected to who I am.

### Self-development: to keep growing, advancing, or improving knowledge, skills, character, or life experience.

I had a very, very hard time choosing the first attribute on the list. 

Between Freedom and Self-development, the fight is very tough. 

I asked the question ‚Äúwould I give up on freedom if that meant I‚Äôd be a better person?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, I would!‚Äù, but then I thought: ‚Äúbut the main reason I want to be a better person is so I can achieve freedom‚Äù. 

Is it, though? Isn‚Äôt the reason self-evident? 

I want to be a better person because that‚Äôs my sole obligation on life, my own (and every other human being‚Äôs) reason to live; I do feel that growing and improving myself is inherent to my existence. 

And I know I wouldn‚Äôt be happy to be free without being self-developing, and neither the other way around. 

I don‚Äôt know which one matters the most, but they are my core values.

### Independence: to be self-supportive, and choose my own way of doing things

This one is very simple: I like doing things in my own way, and I take responsibility for that.

### Contribution: to contribute, help, assist, or make a positive difference to myself or others

There are few things that make me more genuinely happy than seeing my friends and the people I like to thrive. 

One of them is to help them thrive.

I am so grateful for all these amazing people I had the luck to get to know along my life, and I want to help them be at their best and achieve their goals, and I‚Äôll work for that happily.

### Creativity: to be creative or innovative

I love constructing things. 

I am happy when I‚Äôm building something new.

**These are the values that I reason with deeply, but didn‚Äôt make into the Top 5 (they are not in order of importance):**

These are my character, and there is no other way of doing differently:

- **Curiosity**: to be curious, open-minded, and interested; to explore and discover
- **Authenticity**: to be authentic, genuine, and real; to be true to myself
- **Gratitude**: to be grateful for and appreciative of the positive aspects of myself, others, and life
- **Honesty**: to be honest, truthful, and sincere with myself and others
- **Assertivity**: speak my mind 

These are what make me thrilled:

- **Courage**: to be courageous or brave; to persist in the face of fear, threat, or difficulty
- **Excitement**: to seek, create, and engage in activities that are exciting, stimulating, or thrilling
- **Adventure**: to be adventurous; to actively seek, create, or explore novel or stimulating experiences

This one is my biggest flaw and needs to be looked at:

- **Self-control**: to act in accordance with my own ideals

These are the things that make me want to wake up every day:

- **Industry**: to be industrious, hard-working, and dedicated
- **Beauty**: to appreciate, create, nurture, or cultivate beauty in myself, others, the environment, etc.

These are how I want to be with other people:

- **Forgiveness**: to be forgiving toward myself or others
- **Friendliness**: to be friendly, companionable, or agreeable toward others
- **Fun**: to be fun-loving; to seek, create, and engage in fun-filled activities
- **Generosity**: to be generous, sharing, and giving, to myself or others
- **Humor**: to see and appreciate the humorous side of life
- **Kindness**: to be kind, compassionate, considerate, nurturing, or caring toward myself or others
