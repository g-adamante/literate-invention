Hello! Welcome to my website. Se você falar português, [seja bem vindo](/ "seja bem vindo.")

I’m Gabriel Adamante. I write about a lot of things, and also fiction (witch I really enjoy). I wrote a short stories book called Tales the World Ending. 

Right now, I’m living in Spain, and working on a translation of Marcus Aurelius Meditations to portuguese. 

You’ll find here some book notes, what I’m doing right now,my Short Stories (in portuguese, I’m afraid :/ ), and some snippets of code or marketing techniques I may have put to use.
